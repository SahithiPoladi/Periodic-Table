• The languages I used for designing the periodic table are HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
• I thought of using SASS for styling but, when I gave a try with CSS and HTML the alignment of cells went well and continued using it though the code was a bit lengthier.
• The periodic table can be clearly seen with s, p, d, f block differentiation.
• For the mouse functions such as mouseover or onclick, I used JavaScript. The code was bit lengthy than expected as each element has some specific information and as it must be displayed, I declared id for each element and wrote the code for onmouseover() and onmouseout() for each element.
• There are 4 blocks named s, p, d, f where on clicking them the specific block is highlighted and rest are disabled and clear all makes sure that the selection comes to original style.
• onmouseover() on element the background of all elements becomes white and a form is displayed with the element information and onmouseout() again the styling is restored according with hiding the form.
